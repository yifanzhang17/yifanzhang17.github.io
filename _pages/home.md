I currently work as a Research Associate at the [Johns Hopkins Biostatistics Center](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-biostatistics-center/). Prior to that, I completed my Master's in Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, where I was advised by [Cristian Tomasetti](https://www.cristiantomasetti.com/).
