<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was using PROC REPORT along with ODS tagsets.simplelatex in SAS to generate LaTeX tables, but some of the tables created this way were too wide to fit on a page. To make the tables fit, I needed to change the width of some columns. An example of edits that need to be made to a tex file:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Change</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

```
\begin{longtable}{|l|l|l|}
```

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>to</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

```
\begin{longtable}{|p{0.75\textwidth}|l|l|}
```

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Initially, we decided to make such changes by manually editing the tex files, but soon realized that with a dozen such tables that needed to be updated regularly, an automated process was more desirable. We wondered if it was possible to dictate the column widths in SAS.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I created my own custom tagsets based on original LaTeX tagsets code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

```
proc template;
 define tagset Tagsets.style1;
    map = '%$&amp;{}~^#_\';
    mapsub= '/\%/\$/\&amp;/\{/\}/\~/\^/\#/{\textunderscore}/\newline/';
 	define event colspec_entry;
 		put 'p{0.75\textwidth}|' /if cmp(just, "l");
 		put 'p{0.1\textwidth}|' /if cmp(just, "r");
 		put 'p{0.2\textwidth}|' /if cmp(just, "c");
		put 'l|' /if cmp(just, "d");
 	end;
 parent = tagsets.simplelatex;
 end;
run;
```

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compare the code above to snippets of the original tagsets code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

```
define tagset tagsets.latex;
    notes 'This is the LaTeX definition';
    stacked_columns = no;
    output_type = 'latex';
    map = '%$&amp;{}~^#_\';
    mapsub= '/\%/\$/\&amp;/\{/\}/\~/\^/\#/{\textunderscore}/{\textbackslash}/'
```

```
define tagset tagsets.simplelatex; parent=tagsets.latex;

    define event colspec_entry;
        put just '|' / if !cmp(just, 'd');
        put 'r|' / if cmp(just, 'd');
    end;
```

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few things to note:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>I also changed the map and mapsub lines since in some cases I wanted to add a line break to the column header, and being able to map <code>\</code>  in SAS to <code>\newline</code> in LaTeX was convenient.</li><li>I set multiple column widths options based on the value of <code>just</code>, which gives me more flexibility, especially in cases where a single table consists of columns that need to be of different widths. However, to use the <code>just</code> option, I had to switch to using PROC TEMPLATE instead of PROC REPORT, which required further modification of my original code.</li></ol>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solution presented above did resolve my needs, but I ended up having to create three custom tagsets to satisfy all the unique requirements of my tables. I think there is perhaps an easier and more elegant solution out there, but an online search of ODS LaTeX tagsets did not provide me with many relevant results. The fact that this is my first time using SAS probably added to the difficulty of finding a solution.</p>
